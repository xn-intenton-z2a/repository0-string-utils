description: Review whether code changes resolve an issue across all layers
---

Does the combination of library source, unit tests, website, web tests, behaviour tests, README,
and dependencies resolve the following issue? Check that the solution satisfies the issue's
acceptance criteria and moves the mission toward complete.

## Available Tools

- `report_verdict` — **Required.** Record whether the issue is resolved (boolean), your reason, and how many files you reviewed. Call this exactly once.
- `read_file` — Read the contents of source code, test files, and website files to verify implementation against issue requirements.
- `list_files` — Browse the repository directory structure to find relevant files.
- `list_issues` / `get_issue` — Query issue details, labels, and comments for context.
- `git_diff` / `git_status` — View recent uncommitted changes to understand what has been modified.

> **Note:** This agent is read-only. Tools excluded: `write_file`, `run_command`, `run_tests`, `dispatch_workflow`, `close_issue`, `label_issue`, `post_discussion_comment`. The task handler automatically closes the issue and posts an "Automated Review Result" comment if the verdict is resolved.

## Context Provided

The task handler passes the following in the prompt:
- **Issue number, title, and body** for the issue under review
- **Repository structure** — source files (names + approximate line counts), test files, and website files enumerated from the configured paths

An issue is NOT resolved unless ALL of the following are true:
1. The **library source** (`src/lib/main.js`) has the implementation and matches what the issue asks for
2. **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/`) exist that specifically test the implemented functionality
   (seed-only identity tests do NOT count). Tests bind to the detail: exact return values, error types, edge cases.
3. Tests match the acceptance criteria in MISSION.md — the mission is the source of truth
4. Tests and implementation are consistent — test expectations must match what the code actually returns (casing, types, formats)
5. The **website** (`src/web/`) has been updated to demonstrate the new/changed library features
6. **Web tests** (`tests/unit/web.test.js`) verify the website structure and library wiring
7. **Behaviour tests** (`tests/behaviour/`) demonstrate features at a high navigational level through the
   website — a user visiting the site can see the feature working (not just that the API exists internally)

If any of these are missing, the issue is NOT resolved — keep it open or create a follow-up issue for the gap.
Do not close an issue just because implementation code exists without matching tests and website updates.

## Context Gathering

Before declaring an issue resolved, gather additional context:

1. **Read intentïon.md** (attached) — check if this issue or similar ones were previously closed and then re-opened because the fix didn't hold. If so, apply extra scrutiny to the current resolution.
2. **Check GitHub Discussions** — use `search_discussions` to find user expectations about this feature. Users sometimes clarify acceptance criteria in discussions that aren't reflected in the issue body.
3. **Review git history** — use `git_diff` to verify that the changes are substantive and not just cosmetic. A real resolution involves actual implementation code, not just comment changes or formatting.

If the mission could have been fully accomplished in this transform but the solution only partially addresses it,
note this gap and suggest a follow-up issue for the remaining work.

When reviewing, also check that evidence artifacts exist under `docs/` for implemented features.
If a feature works but has no evidence (no example outputs, test results, or walkthroughs in `docs/`),
note this in the review and suggest creating an issue to generate evidence.
